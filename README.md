## Description

Compose-Quote-App is a simple Android application built with **Jetpack Compose** that reads quotes from a JSON file and displays them in a list. It showcases the usage of Jetpack Compose for building modern UIs in Android applications. The app follows the **MVVM architecture** pattern and utilizes **Hilt Dependency Injection** for efficient and maintainable code. Asynchronous programming is handled using **Coroutines**.

### Technologies Used:

- **Jetpack Compose**
- **MVVM**
- **Hilt Dependency Injection**
- **Coroutines**

Compose-Quote-App showcases best practices in Android development by leveraging these technologies.
